## Overview

This project involves the analysis of a dataset to predict the length of stay of patients in a hospital. The tasks include data preparation, transformation, and predictive modeling. The code is organized into several key tasks, each addressing a specific aspect of the data preparation and analysis process.

## Tasks Breakdown

### Task 1: Loading the Data

This task involves loading the dataset from a CSV file and displaying the first few rows to understand its structure.

**Code:**
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/Train-1542865627584.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(df.head())
```

### Task 2: Handling Missing Values

The dataset contains missing values that need to be addressed for accurate analysis. This task calculates the percentage of missing values for each column and replaces missing values with the mean for numerical columns and the mode for categorical columns.

**Code:**
```python
# Calculate the percentage of missing values for each column
missing_values_percentage = df.isnull().sum() / len(df) * 100
print(missing_values_percentage)

# Replace missing values with the mean for numerical columns and the mode for categorical columns
for column in df.columns:
    if df[column].dtype == 'object':
        df[column].fillna(df[column].mode()[0], inplace=True)
    else:
        df[column].fillna(df[column].mean(), inplace=True)
```

### Task 3: Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is crucial for enhancing the predictive power of machine learning models. This task creates new features such as "Total Charges," which is the product of "Bed Grade" and "Visitors with Patient."

**Code:**
```python
# Feature Engineering: Create new feature 'Total Charges'
df['Total Charges'] = df['Bed Grade'] * df['Visitors with Patient']
print(df[['Bed Grade', 'Visitors with Patient', 'Total Charges']].head())
```

### Task 4: Transforming Categories into Numbers

Machine learning algorithms require numerical input. This task transforms categorical features into numerical values using LabelEncoder.

**Code:**
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# List of categorical features
categorical_features = ['Hospital_type_code', 'Hospital_region_code', 'Department', 'Ward_Type', 'Ward_Facility_Code', 'Type of Admission', 'Severity of Illness', 'Age']

# Initialize LabelEncoder
le = LabelEncoder()

# Transform each categorical feature into numerical values
for feature in categorical_features:
    df[feature] = le.fit_transform(df[feature])

print(df[categorical_features].head())
```

## Requirements

To run the code, you need the following packages:
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install these packages using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

## Running the Code

1. Load the dataset by specifying the correct path to the CSV file.
2. Execute the code for each task sequentially.
3. Ensure all necessary libraries are imported.
4. Review the transformed data and proceed with further analysis or model building as needed.

## Notes

- The dataset should be cleaned and preprocessed as shown in the tasks above.
- Additional feature engineering may be performed based on the specific requirements of the analysis.
- Ensure that all transformations are correctly applied before using the data for modeling.

This README provides an overview of the tasks performed for data preparation and transformation. Further steps can be taken to build predictive models and evaluate their performance based on this processed data.
